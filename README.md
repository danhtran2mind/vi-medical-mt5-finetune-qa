## Introduction

This repository provides a **Vietnamese medical question‚Äëanswering system** built by fine‚Äëtuning the **mT5** model on the **UIT‚ÄëViCoV19QA** dataset. This model achieves low loss on both training (‚âà‚ÄØ0.306) and validation (‚âà‚ÄØ0.323) sets, indicating strong performance for Vietnamese‚Äëlanguage medical queries.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: Downloadable from the linked GitHub repository.  
- **Demo**: An interactive Gradio interface is available both as a screenshot and a live Hugging Face Space.  
- **Usage**: Simple installation steps, model download commands, and a one‚Äëline command to launch the app locally (`python app.py`).  
- **Environment**: Tested with Python‚ÄØ3.10.12 and a specific set of library versions (e.g., `transformers==4.47.0`, `torch==2.5.1+cu121`).

The project is ready for researchers and developers who need a Vietnamese‚Äëlanguage medical QA system that can be deployed locally or integrated into larger applications.
